# Implementation of EMPATH on Brazilian Sign language (LIBRAS) recognition to sign language dataset creatio

This project is a proof of concept on the creation of a Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) dataset based on the implementation of Ensemble Learning with Attention-based Transformer (EMPATH), a sign language recognition specialized algorithim with 97% accuracy on the recognition of brazilian sign language.

The project is divided in two parts, one called [transformer training.ipynb](git\EMPATH_LIBRAS\transformer training.ipynb) used to process the data using media pipe to create parquet files to normalize the model inputs, and train the EMPATH model for LIBRAS recognition, and the other called [finalizacao.ipynb](git\EMPATH_LIBRAS\finalizacao.ipynb) used to implement the EMPATH model on congress sessions to proof the possibility of creating a dataset using this methodlogy.
